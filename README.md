A login bruteforcing script that takes in a pair of wordlists and runs them against a specified HTML login page. The script will attempt every possible combination with the goal of guessing correct login information.

**Disclaimer:** This will not work with python2 so please run this script with python3.


Note: Some constants/variables need to be changed according to the webpage and the form name. These have been highlighted with "TODO"s.
